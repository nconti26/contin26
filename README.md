[Robot Face](https:/nconti26.github.io/RobotFace/)
> In this project I used shapes, variable, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

[Captioned Scenes](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2023/lessons/11/levels/5)
> This project is an underwater scene of a school of fish being chased by a shark. 

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/aYQartNfSD6tJPv7jRmJfj44vEiK9aaRlv6LXHqGtms)
>In this project, I collaborated with another student to create a congratulation poster. We used conditional statements to control and effect different variables in our project.

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/hVen3z3gyub7lvOVGJnN7HPRB6VlSKdkFIDa-LPnt60)
>In this project I worked with another student to make a game where it included a character, target, and obstacles. We made the character move up and down to try and colect carrots and avoid the bushes. 

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/VZ_cVb4iR_lxbMHr4kUAxv5lwK0lyT1rtZfeCMsKVyA)
>In this project we mde an obstacle game with the objective to not get thrown off the screen. We want to avoid the fireballs and avoid the enemy ships or else if they push our ship out of site, its game over.

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/EFKmxJfLJ9F8bawSACij9sjjypTsRDfKVJ9udtYufDc)
In this project I collaborated with a partner to create a game where a sprite, our bunny is falling, but the player uses the arrows to jump from platform to platform to collect carrots and get their score higher. 

[Project - Design a Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/trHiguNngY5CKa6aFj8Lf0-kiYkEdbza1YOIOFcmVaU)
>In this project I made a goal for a fish to get its score up b pushing down the enemy shark to help stop them from touching the egg, or else the score will go down. 

### MIT App Inventor
[Animal sounds](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=c6a8e8a6-9823-4faa-93c8-f4c403644747)
>In this app, one can press on the animals to make their realmlife sounds.

[Piano Project](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=56310b3e-fa82-4678-868b-e88290ded58f)
>In this project, there is an interactive piano where if one clicks on the keys to the piano, it will play.

[Music Maker](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=661711ad-8cf9-40ea-a795-aebf82b8abb9)
>In this project one can click on the different instruments to play their different sounds. 

[Find The Gold](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#5848620139937792)
>In this project one has to avoid hitting the walls with their ball to go through a course to find the maze. 

[Food Chase] (https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#4711762697781248)

[Colorado Mountains] (https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/exercise/4132/)
In this project, I created a scene from Colorado. In the scene there is a house on mountains looking over a huge lake with a nice sunset.
